Justify with data-backed evidence."],"metadata":{"id":"B3HN4kcVoDOZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Based on the analysis we've conducted, here are some data-backed insights that can inform a pricing strategy for a new laptop brand entering the Indian market:\n","\n","RAM is a key price driver: Our feature importance analysis clearly showed that RAM is the most significant predictor of laptop price (with a feature importance of 0.57). Laptops with higher RAM tend to be priced significantly higher.\n","Weight and TypeName (Notebooks) are also important: Weight and the 'Notebook' type also showed notable importance in price prediction. Lighter laptops and notebooks tend to have different price points.\n","\n","Screen quality matters: The analysis of screen quality categories (HD, Full HD, 2K/QHD, 4K) revealed a clear upward trend in average price as resolution increases. Offering higher resolution displays can justify higher price points.\n","Operating System influences price: Laptops with macOS and Windows 7 had the highest average prices, while those with Linux, No OS, and Chrome OS were generally lower priced. The choice of operating system can impact the perceived value and target price range.\n","\n","Gaming laptops command a premium: Laptops classified as \"Gaming\" based on their GPU type had a significantly higher average price compared to \"Non-Gaming\" laptops. Targeting the gaming segment allows for higher pricing.\n","\n","Lightweight laptops can be priced higher: Our hypothesis test showed that lightweight laptops (<1.5 kg) are statistically significantly more expensive on average than heavier ones. There's a market willing to pay more for portability.\n","Potential Pricing Strategies:\n","\n","Target the Premium Segment: Focus on offering laptops with high RAM (16GB+), high-resolution displays (2K/QHD or 4K), dedicated gaming GPUs, and potentially a lightweight design. These features are associated with higher prices and cater to the premium market willing to pay for performance and portability.\n","\n","Target the Mid-Range Segment: Offer laptops with 8GB or 16GB RAM, Full HD displays, and a balance between performance (CPU/GPU) and price. This segment is the largest in terms of laptop type ('Notebook') and screen size (15.6 inches), indicating a high demand.\n","\n","Offer Variety with Clear Feature-Based Pricing Tiers: Create distinct product lines with clear differences in RAM, screen resolution, GPU type, and storage (SSD vs. HDD). Price these tiers accordingly, aligning with the observed price trends based on these features.\n","\n","Consider the Operating System: While Windows 10 is prevalent, offering options with Linux or No OS can cater to budget-conscious consumers, while a premium OS like macOS (if feasible for a new brand) could target a higher-paying demographic.\n","Justification with Data:\n","\n","The strong correlation between RAM and Price (from feature importance) justifies pricing tiers based on RAM size.\n","The higher average prices for 4K and 2K/QHD resolutions support premium pricing for laptops with better screen quality.\n","\n","The significant price difference between gaming and non-gaming laptops validates a higher price strategy for performance-oriented models.\n","\n","The finding that lightweight laptops are more expensive on average supports a premium for ultraportable models.\n","By leveraging these data-backed insights, a new laptop brand can strategically position itself in the Indian market and design a pricing structure that aligns with consumer expectations and the value provided by different specifications.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"e601_M9eoZpq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2.
